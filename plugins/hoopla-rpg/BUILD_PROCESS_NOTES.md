# Hoopla RPG Plugin Build Process Notes

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: NO BUILD REQUIRED

### Key Finding:
The Hoopla RPG plugin uses TypeScript with `"noEmit": true` in `tsconfig.json`, which means:

- ✅ **Omegga runs TypeScript files directly** - no compilation needed
- ✅ **No JavaScript files are generated** 
- ✅ **`npm run build` does nothing** (because of `noEmit: true`)
- ✅ **Plugin main points to `omegga.plugin.ts`** (TypeScript file)

### Correct Workflow:
1. **Edit `.ts` files directly**
2. **Reload plugin in Omegga** (`/reload hoopla-rpg`)
3. **Changes take effect immediately**

### What NOT to do:
- ❌ **Don't run `npm run build`** - it's unnecessary
- ❌ **Don't look for compiled `.js` files** - they don't exist
- ❌ **Don't change `noEmit` to `false`** - it will break the setup

### When Build WOULD be needed:
- If `noEmit` was set to `false` in `tsconfig.json`
- If complex build steps were added (webpack, bundling, etc.)
- If external libraries requiring compilation were used

### Current Status:
**Plugin runs TypeScript directly through Omegga's built-in TypeScript support.**
